# June 8th: Finished adding my pcb parts in, didn't wire yet tho

So I added two microphones, a battery, a Raspberry Pi 4, two speakers, 3 push buttons, an audio amplifier, and a charging module. This is basically the basis of my boombox! I will prob update it when i get feedback but this is the WIP
